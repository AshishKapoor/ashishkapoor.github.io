      </p>
      <p>
        At Rill, I architecture and created the MVP for the SaaS-based resource
        control panel with React JS to a stable product in 8 months.
        Contributing to Apache DruidTM. Currently, owning the entire web UI
        stack with Apache DruidTM as a service. While also successfully and
        securely migrated and maintained legacy web UI systems of MetaMarkets
        for multiple clients in 3 months. It gave me a lot of joy as I got the
        opportunity to work on modern data stack and architecture and create
        useful tools for the leading developers and data scientists in the
        space. Rill is the fastest path to operational intelligence. As the
        world&#x2019;s first truly elastic, fully managed cloud service for Apache
        DruidTM, we enabled data teams to deliver operational intelligence to
        their business stakeholders with zero DevOps overhead.

        When I joined the company, it was called Quid, Inc. I created and
        converted CoffeeScript code to React. While doing so I also helped
        customers with getting custom features in the UI around data
        visualisation and related tools. Fixed complicated issues with backend
        in ruby communicating through GraphQL. Quid, Inc. is a private software
        and services company, specialising in text-based data analysis. Quid
        software can read millions of documents and offers insight by organising
        that content visually.
